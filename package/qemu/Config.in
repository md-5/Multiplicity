	  QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

	  When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made
	  for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g.
	  your own PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good
	  performance.

	  When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances
	  by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. QEMU supports
	  virtualization when executing under the Xen hypervisor or using the
	  KVM kernel module in Linux. When using KVM, QEMU can virtualize x86,
	  server and embedded PowerPC, and S390 guests.
